# SAE2.01

This project was the final project of the first year of my studies. 
However, it was quite complicated and we couldn't finish the project in time, so it lacks a lot of functionality and there are errors in the code. We were still able to deploy the application, an .exe executes the application in the "Deploiment" folder. Despite the fact that the project is not complete at all, it is still interesting because it was the first time that we coded a real graphical interface with an application.

Project made by Rapheal LACOTE, Dorian HODIN

PS : All of my project are in french.
